## TrayLauncher

TrayLauncher is a customizable menu to launch applications, websites, documents, settings, folders and progressive web apps (PWAs) from the system tray area of the taskbar. You can use the TrayLauncher menu to launch your favorite applications, open frequently used folders and websites, or to open that infrequently used program or setting that takes you minutes to locate. You can use TrayLauncher instead of having a desktop full of documents and shortcuts.
